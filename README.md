# Simple-Emacs
## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Emacs config for **ETNA** students. It is made
to serve as a sane basis for building your own Emacs configuration.

## Installation

Delete your existing =.emacs.d= folder then execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Natsukki/Simple-Emacs.git .emacs.d && emacs
```

Emacs will send fetch and install the required packages. Once it is done, it may
require restarting emacs.
